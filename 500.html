<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>
<p>The server encountered an internal error or
misconfiguration and was unable to complete
your request.</p>

<h2>If you were trying to attach a file...</h2>

<p>If you were trying to attach a file (especially a build log), please
verify that you have <em>read permissions</em> to that file. Browsers
tend not to implement error handling, and instead submit a malformed
request when they cannot read the file.</p>

<p>If this is the case, please use chmod or chown to ensure that your
user can read the file, and try again. Most browsers support
resubmitting the request without losing data through refreshing the page
(<kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd>).</p>

<p>For more details, please see this Firefox bug report from 2008:
<a rel="external" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=426177">
Should give error message when file upload fails due to insufficient permissions
</a>.</p>

<h2>Otherwise...</h2>

<p>Please contact the server administrator at 
 webmaster@gentoo.org to inform them of the time this error occurred,
 and the actions you performed just before this error.</p>
<p>More information about this error may be available
in the server error log.</p>
