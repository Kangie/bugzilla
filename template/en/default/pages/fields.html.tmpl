          All attempts at reproducing this [% terms.bug %] were futile,

          The [% terms.bug %] might have been reproduced successfully, however
          there is no viable fix for it. Either there is no fix at all, or
          applying an existing fix would introduce new disadvantages that
          outweigh its advantages. If a viable fix appears later, the [% terms.bug %] can
          be reponened.

          The information contained in the [% terms.bug %] is not sufficient
          to efficiently trace the origin of the problem. Usually, the person
          closing the [% terms.bug %] with this resolution will also note what
          further information is required. Once that information is provided,
          the [% terms.bug %] can be reponened.

          A fix for the issue described in the [% terms.bug %] was provided.
          The author requests users who were affected by the issue to test
          the provided fix and report any success or failures.
          When the problem is confirmedly fixed,
          the [% terms.bug %] becomes [% display_value("resolution", "FIXED") FILTER html %],
          if the problem still exists, it can be reopened.

          The [% terms.bug %] describes an issue that is should be fixed by
          the upstream, or original author or provider of the subject of the [% terms.bug %].
          Addressing the issue on the level of the Gentoo project ("downstream")
          is either not possible or merely a workaround not worth implementing.
